# Challenge 3 - Password Generator: Code Refactor

## Final Deployed Webpage

[Generate a random password!](https://j03b.github.io/password-generator/)

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to make the password generator website functional using Javascript.

### Site Specifications

Create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected (including special characters). This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### Mock Up

### Task Completed

This week's task was to modify existing code, otherwise known as refactoring. This process is to improve it without changing what it does outside of the acceptance criteria so it meets a certain set of standards or implements a new technology. In this case, a company has hired me to refactor an existing site to generate their employee passwords.
One of the most important considerations is to ensure that the passwords meet the company criteria. The tech lead has given me a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

#### Exceeding Expectations

To impress clients, I always strive to exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, there were small bugs in the codebase that I fixed to ensure everything functions correctly. I clean up, organize, and consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments for each important element or section of the page.

## Instructions

### Testing the deployed site

To test the changes made for this project, you can ensure that the deployed site generates random passwords. The goals for this project are listed out in the acceptance criteria below. 

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

Please note that I do not "own" the final project and its contents in this repository. Please consider the project an example of work that I have done to quickly satisfy a client's basic needs.
